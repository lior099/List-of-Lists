# List-of-Lists

Lior Shifman and Haim Isakov

This repository is about our implementation of a Dataset called List of Lists(LOL), which can represent a Graph in python in a very memory efficient way.

NOTE: Currently it's a WORK IN PROGGRESS which means some bugs are expected, and there is still no full documentaion of the project and how to use it.
